This project was done as the final project in spring 23 for HADM 3710/6710 at Cornell University. 

The Key objectives are: 
+ Create and populate a database using data in the Excel file, without modifying the Excel file.  The tables [and fields] should be:
     bottle_sizes [bottle_size_id, bottle_size]
     vintages [vintage_id, vintage]
     wineries [winery_id, winery, country]
     wines[wine_id, wine, winery_id, vintage_id, rating_score, bottle_size_id, bottles_purchased, bottles_on_hand, drink_through]
+ Develop the best prediction model you can for the average_purchase_price using any variables that you can derive from the data
+ Report the accuracy of the predictions in appropriate ways
